# Setup
1. Copy the [api key from mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/help/about-api-keys/) as the whole body of [secrets.txt](secrets.txt)

If you're having issues with the app 
1. Run ` npm list` in the terminal. If it does not print ` markdown-to-mailchimp`, install [Markdown2Mailchimp](https://github.com/MarcL/markdown-to-mailchimp)
```bash
npm install markdown-to-mailchimp
```

# How it works 
The script, [prep_newsletter.sh](prep_newsletter.sh), will take a YAML frontmatter generated from the google sheet and a markdown file with the content of the newsletter and combine them into a single markdown file. This will then be slotted into a MJML template ([template.mjml](template.mjml)) that Markdown2Mailchimp turns into a HTML file and uploads to mailchimp.

# To Use
1. run `./prep_newsletter.sh` and follow the instructions, when it opens the files 
2. Copy in the YAML section from the google sheet into the frontmatter file
3. Edit the content of the newsletter
4. Hit save on both of them
5. Continue the sheet until it pushes to mailchimp
